## Mission Statement: 
***ODS should be the standard used for exposure data, result outputs and contract(s) terminology for the (Re)Insurance industry and other interested parties in catastrophe modelling and exposure management across all classes of business.***

# Open Data Standards (ODS)

ODS is curated by Oasis LMF and governed by the Open Data Standards Steering Committee (SC), comprised of industry experts representing (re)insurers, brokers, service providers and catastrophe model vendors.  

This is a separate repository specifically for the Open Results Data (ORD) standard which will be developed independently of the Open Exposure Data (OED) standard that can be found
here (https://github.com/OasisLMF/ODS_OpenExposureData). All details on the governance and signoff process and the role of the ODS Steering Committee can also be found on the OED repo.

Further information and community views of ODS can be found on the ODS website:
